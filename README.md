# apporbit

There are 2 assignments in this project.

1. apporbit_shell.sh

This will take in command line parameters and work with no parmaters as well.

As asked in the requirement.

2. Wordpress, Varnish and Mysql.

This assignment is done using docker-compose. I have used Hub images and Dockerfile both.

To spin up type ```` docker-compose up -d ```` in the wordpress directory.
